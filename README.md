# GreenDerive
Yet another SATySFi library for displaying derivation trees.

**Cauison**: This library is still under development and unstable.

SATySFi provides standard package `proof` for writing derivation tree. The difference between `proof` and GreenDerive is:

* GreenDerive provides a DSL for writing derivations, which allows you to write descriptive SATySFi code
* GreenDerive supports putting labels on both side, and also supports derivations with dotted line or no line
* GreenDerive gives better layout (at least the author thinks so)
